First pass: find defs and add to symbol table. E.g. Module 1: xy's address is 2, Module 4: z's address is 15

Dealing with words:
Ignore first digit
Address is next three digits
Last digit is address type

e.g. 10043. Relative address (bc last digit is 3) is 004

Leave immediate addresses alone
Leave absolute addresses alone, except there is an error check
Change relatvie addresses to abolsute addresses by addin base address

Uses:
E.g.: z 4
Z is used in word 4 (based 0). 

Word 4 (70024) means replace this external address (002) with z. The 002 is replaced with 015, but 002(4) also tells you what the next word to use z is.
Word 2 (27774). 777 is sentiel that means linked list is done.
