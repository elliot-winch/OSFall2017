Elliot Winch Lab 2 README

My solution to Lab 2 is written in C. I used the GCC compiler to compile it on both my machine and crackle1. 

This project includes the following files:

main.c
main.h
OutputBuilder.c
OutputBuilder.h
ProcessMethods.c
ProcessMethods.h
FCFS.c
FCFS.h
SJF.c
SJF.h
RR.c
RR.h
HPRN.c
HPRN.h
random-numbers

This project uses a rudimentary makefile to simplify compilation.
The commands to compile this project are:

make clean 					//deletes all .o and .out files. Not needed on first compilation

make 							//compiles all files and creates the executable called 'main'

./main [--verbose] inputFile   //runs the program. The verbose flag is optional. inputFile is the relative path to some input file

The program will output verbose data if the flag is supplied.
The program will supply each process' end data and a summary for four scheduling algorithms: 
First Come First Serve
Round Robin
Shortest Job First
Highest Penality Ration Next

If the file 'random-numbers' does no exist in the directory, the program will alert you that it is missing
and exit.
